    <p>Amongst the various types of <strong><u>breast</u> cancer</strong>, luminal B subtype is the most common in young women, 
    and ESR1-CCDC170 (E:C) fusion is the most frequent oncogenic fusion driver of the luminal B subtype. Nevertheless, treatments targeting E:C fusion 
    has not been well established yet. Hence, the aim of this study is to investigate for potential therapies targeting E:C fusion based 
    on systematic bioinformatical analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data.

    </p><p style = "<margin-top:45;"">1,000 genes related were extracted using transcriptome 
    analysis, and major signaling pathways associated with breast cancer were identified with over-representation analysis. 
    Then, we conducted drug-target network analysis based on OncoKB and CIViC database, and finally selected potentially applicable drug candidates. 
    Six major cancer related signaling pathways (p53, ATR/ATM, FOXM1, hedgehog, cell cycle, and Aurora B) were significantly altered in E:C fusion positive 
    cases of breast cancer. Further investigation revealed that nine genes (AURKB, HDAC2, PLK1, CENPA, CHEK1, CHEK2, RB1, CCNA2, and MDM2) in coordination 
    with E:C fusion were found to be common denominators for three or more of these pathways, thereby making them promising gene
    biomarkers for target therapy.</p>
